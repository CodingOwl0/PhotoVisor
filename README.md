PhotoVisor helps you organize your images using the arrow keys, allowing you to sort your photos faster than ever before.

    How do I use PhotoVisor?
    Simply press one of the following arrow keys:
    Right → View the next image
    Left → View the previous image
    Up → Keep the current image and view the next one
    Down → Move the current image to the bin and view the next one

    Once all images have been sorted, the bin will be automatically displayed.
    At this point, you can either delete images from the bin or recover them.

Installation
A ready-to-use installer is available on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/photovisor/
